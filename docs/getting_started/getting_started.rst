What is the Taxonomy Design Studio?
-----------------------------------
At a high-level, the taxonomy design studio is a generic tool for organizing complex heterogenous (series) data. It provides a few tools for both defining taxonomies and browsing data tagged using the defined taxonomies. This tool was designed as part of a broader integration platform, the Unified Data and Compute Platform (UDCP), for the `MCpsych project <https://wellcomeleap.org/mcpsych/>`_.

Motivation
----------
The MCpsych modeling and model integration infrastructure, the Unified Data and Compute Platform, incorporates data, model and code repositories and tools for supporting the integration, testing and validation and execution of end-to-end models. The core requirements for UDCP are to:

1. provide transparency, reproducibility, and traceability for datasets, model components, integrated models, and modeling pipelines,
2. accommodate heterogeneity of research platforms used by the research teams, and
3. enforce privacy and proprietary restrictions as defined in the Data Use Agreement of the MCpsych program.

UDCP has not been designed to replace MCpsych teams' development platforms. Its role is to make artifacts delivered by the program participants findable, accessible, integratable and reusable for creating end-to-end models.
Since UDCP hosts a large number of heterogeneous and interdependent computational objects (the reposited versions of data, model and code), content organization and dependency tracking are important concerns. 
Content organization in UDCP is built on taxonomies that provide a systematic way of tagging content. Tags are used for searching and tracking dependencies among computational objects.
